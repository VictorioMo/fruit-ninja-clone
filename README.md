# 🍉 Fruit Ninja Clone

**Fruit Ninja** game clone built in **Unity** as part of my C# Masterclass learning journey.  
The goal is to slice as many fruits as possible while avoiding bombs.  
This project was built to improve visuals, input control, and gameplay flow.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Fruits are launched into the air with random speed and direction.  
- Swipe across the screen (or drag the mouse) to slice fruits mid-air.  
- Each slice earns points — but hitting a bomb ends the game!

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Implemented 2D physics-based motion
- Used prefab instantiation for random fruit and bomb spawning  
- Applied collision detection with trail slicing effect  
- Handled mouse/touch input for gesture-like controls  
- Managed score tracking and game over logic
- Added particle effects and audio feedback for slicing (not yet)
- Designed UI transitions (game over screen)
